  <b>Cochlear nucleus slice recording.</b> Hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -50 mV elicited mixed-cation (Ih) and potassium (Ik) currents, respectively. The biocytin-labeled cell was identified as a t-stellate (inset) [John Wittig 2003].

Barn owls catch mice scurrying in the dark by telling which ear sound arrives at first—to within a microsecond! The brain's **sound localization** trick relies on the coincidence of precisely timed excitatory and inhibitory inputs, with excitation leading in one ear and inhibition in the other.

> By modeling potassium channels found in auditory neurons, we have developed silicon neurons that lock on to acoustic features.

Low-threshold **potassium channels** open when the membrane voltage is below the threshold for spiking; they prevent the voltage from increasing further by shunting synaptic inputs. But these channels open with a delay of a few milliseconds. Thus, the large number of synaptic inputs received at onsets and peaks can raise the membrane voltage fast enough to outrace the potassium current and produce a spike with negligible delay.

> From its detection in the ear to its perception in the cortex, sound is encoded with extreme precision.

Sound is separated into its constituent tones by the cochlea, a spiral structure in the inner ear. The cochlea's basilar membrane vibrates at its base when stimulated by high frequencies and vibrates at its apex when stimulated by low frequencies; the location progresses smoothly from base to apex as frequency drops. Spike discharges in the auditory nerve signal these vibrations to the brain, reporting them moment by moment, up to a few thousand times per second.
