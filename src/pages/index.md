      We are reverse-engineering the computing brain—linking the seemingly
      disparate fields of electrical engineering and computer science with
      neurobiology and medicine.

    title: About Us
    content: >-
        <br>
        We are a group of engineers, theorists, and scientists seeking to reverse-engineer principles of neural design and apply them to solve societal problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our philosophy is always _forward-looking_: as we aim for problems 100x or 1000x more complex than those of today, the solutions we develop must remain feasible and energy-efficient into the future. The current track of deep learning has impressively produced a doubling of performance on some benchmark tasks in the mere span of five years—but at the cost of emitting 10,000x more carbon emissions during training. In contrast, the brain is a paragon for energy-efficiency: a similar 10,000-fold increase in the energy used during training (i.e., neural development) amounts to maturing a human brain rather than a rat brain. To do so, the brain utilizes neurons as a primitive computational unit and their sparse firing as an expressive and efficient code. Our work exploits those primitives and codes to design scalable systems that can be programmed with ease. We envision a world where neuromorphic systems enable everything from personal prosthetics to smart cities and are deployed throughout society’s technological infrastructure.
