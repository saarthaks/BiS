      We are reverse-engineering the computing brain—linking the seemingly
      disparate fields of electrical engineering and computer science with
      neurobiology and medicine.

    title: About Us
    content: >-
        <br>
        We are a group of engineers, theorists, and scientists seeking to reverse-engineer principles of neural design and apply them to solve societal problems. Our philosophy is _forward-looking_. We anticipate problems hundreds to thousands of times more complex than those of today. Thus we seek technological solutions that handle this complexity efficiently and scalably.
        <br><br>
        Today's deep learning solutions scale poorly. Emitting 10,000-fold more carbon to train a deep net only doubles its performance on benchmark tasks. The next doubling in performance will emit as much CO<sub>2</sub> as New York City does in a month.
        <br><br>
        In contrast, the brain learns extremely efficiently. A child masters language by the age of 6, having heard at most 65 million words. That’s 15,000-fold less than the trillion words used to train GPT-3. Equivalently, a child that learns language at the same rate as GPT-3 would be 90,000 years old before it could converse fluently. By reverse-engineering how the brain uses so little data to learn, we hope to invent solutions that enable a sustainable technological future.
