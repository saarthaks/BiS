        Brains in Silicon is committed to making neuromorphic computing a more open and inclusive field, so we strongly encourage applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds or from underrepresented groups.
        <h4>Undergraduate and Graduate Students</h4>
        The Brains in Silicon Lab at Stanford University welcomes students from a wide-range of academic backgrounds. We encourage you to explore our ongoing <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/projects">projects</a> and recent <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/publications">publications</a> for a clear picture of our current research.
        <br>
        <br>
        To join, we recommend emailing a resumé and brief introduction to <a href="mailto:boahen@stanford.edu">Kwabena Boahen</a>, as well as any other <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/team">current students</a> whose interests may align with your own.
        <h4>Postdocs</h4>
        The Brains in Silicon Lab at Stanford University is looking to recruit a postdoc with expertise in event-based vision. Of particular interest are candidates with experience in systems, algorithms, applications, hardware-software co-design, or behavioral modeling aspects of event-based vision. You need not necessarily be a chip person; you will work closely with team members at Stanford and elsewhere performing that role.

        <br>
        <strong>Project Background:</strong> Our Northrop Grumman-led team includes our group (Stanford) as well as <a href="http://andreoulab.net/">Andreas Andreou’s group</a> (JHU) and <a href="https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php">Gert Cauwenbergh’s group</a> (UCSD). We’re designing a 3D-integrated imager-processor system, funded by DARPA’s <a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/sensors/article/14184786/electrooptical-sensors-machine-learning">FENCE</a> program. Imager pixels and processor cores are on separate chips. These two chips are stacked with a through-silicon-via (TSV) for each pixel signal. A bit-serial network-on-a-chip (NoC) routes pixel-produced events to cores. A bit-parallel NoC routes data between cores. Both NoCs are asynchronous. Our contribution to the project builds on work we published on a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/documents/serial-h-tree.pdf">bit-serial NoC</a> and a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/documents/MerollaEtAlRouterFinal.pdf">bit-parallel interchip network</a> as well as on the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/documents/06_ZaghloulBoahenJNE06.pdf">silicon retina</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>To Apply:</strong> Email a CV, a research statement, and contact information for three references to <a href="mailto:boahen@stanford.edu">Kwabena Boahen</a>, with the subject “FENCE Postdoc Application”. The position is available now applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until it is filled.
