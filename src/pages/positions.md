        The Brains in Silicon Lab at Stanford University is committed to making neuromorphic computing a more open and inclusive field and welcomes individuals with unique academic training and diverse cultural identity.

        If our ongoing <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/projects">projects</a> and recent <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/publications">publications</a> interest you, email a resumé and brief introduction to <a href="mailto:boahen@stanford.edu">Dr. Kwabena Boahen</a>, as well as <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/people">current lab members</a> you identify with.
        We are currently recruiting undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs for the following recently-funded projects:

        <br><br>
        <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/2022-hoffman-yee-grant-recipients#dendritic"><h4>Dendritic Computation for Knowledge Systems</h4></a>

        This project funded by Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) brings together <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/">Dr. Scott Linderman</a>'s group (Stanford Statistics), <a href="https://nano.stanford.edu">Dr. Philip Wong</a>'s group (Stanford EE), and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/matei/">Dr. Matei Zaharia</a>'s group (Stanford CS). This multidisciplinary collaboration aims to develop dendrite-like nanodevices, fabrication techniques to integrate them in 3-D, and a circuit-switched routing fabric to interconnect them.

        <br><br>
        <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2223827"><h4>Dendritic Processing of Spike Sequences in Biological and Artificial Brains</h4></a>

        This NSF-funded project brings together <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/">Dr. Scott Linderman</a>'s group (Stanford Statistics), <a href="https://rsg.stanford.edu">Dr. Subhashish Mitra</a>'s group (Stanford EE), <a href="http://www.steinmetzlab.net">Dr. Nick Steinmetz</a>'s group (Univ. of Washington, Dept. of Biological Structure), <a href="https://nano.stanford.edu">Dr. Philip Wong</a>'s group (Stanford EE), and <a href="https://research.ninds.nih.gov/zaghloul-lab">Dr. Kareem Zaghloul</a>'s group (NIH NINDS), and our group. This multidisciplinary collaboration aims to uncover how an ensemble of neurons learns to encode and a stretch of dendrite learns to decode information in a sequence of spikes and to implement those learning rules in a 3-D chip.

        <br><br>
        <a><h4>The Synaptic Organization of Dendrites</h4></a>

        This project co-funded by Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) and Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute brings together <a href="https://toliaslab.org">Dr. Andreas Tolias</a>'s group (Stanford Ophthalmology) and our group. This multidisciplinary collaboration aims to discover anatomical signatures of spike-sequence coding in dendrites by mining the <a href="https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3">MICrONS</a> consortium's nanoscale 3-D reconstruction of over 100,000 neurons and 500 million synaptic connections.

        <br><br>
        <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/digital-transformation/neuromorphic-cameras-provide-a-vision-of-the-future/"><h4>Sparse Event Neuromorphic Technology for Infrared Visuals</h4></a>

        This project funded by DARPA’s <a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/sensors/article/14184786/electrooptical-sensors-machine-learning">FENCE</a> program is led by Northrop Grumman and includes <a href="http://andreoulab.net/">Dr. Andreas Andreou</a>’s group (JHU), <a href="https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php">Dr. Gert Cauwenbergh</a>’s group (UCSD), and our group as university partners. This consortium is developing a smart camera by stacking detector, pixel, and processor in 3D. These elements are interconnected with through-silicon-vias (TSV) and face-to-face-bonded Cu-Cu pads. Our group is designing a bit-serial network-on-a-chip (NoC) to route configuration data to the processors and a bit-parallel NoC to route processed events to the periphery. This work builds on our <a href="https:/web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/documents/serial-h-tree.pdf">bit-serial NoC</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/documents/MerollaEtAlRouterFinal.pdf">bit-parallel interchip network</a>, and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/documents/06_ZaghloulBoahenJNE06.pdf">silicon retina</a>, and spans analog circuit design, asynchronous logic design, hardware-software co-design, embedded systems, and event-based vision algorithms.

<!-- The Brains in Silicon Lab at Stanford University is looking to recruit a postdoc with expertise in event-based vision. Of particular interest are candidates with experience in systems, algorithms, applications, hardware-software co-design, or behavioral modeling aspects of event-based vision. You need not necessarily be a chip person; you will work closely with team members at Stanford and elsewhere performing that role.


Brains in Silicon is committed to making neuromorphic computing a more open and inclusive field, so we strongly encourage applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds or from underrepresented groups. -->
