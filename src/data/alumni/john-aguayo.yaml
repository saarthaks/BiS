bio: My interests lie at the intersection of computer science, neuroscience and software
  engineering. In particular, I'm interested in how distributed systems (whether they
  are software, hardware or neural) are designed and developed to carry out specific
  goals and tasks. My goal in the Brains in Silicon lab is to develop software that
  will enhance the experience of the neuromorphic systems being researched and developed
  in the lab.
