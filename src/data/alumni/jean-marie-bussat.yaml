bio: Being an engineer, I've always been amazed by the way nature finds solutions
  to complex problems. I believe a robot brain has to model the biological brain to
  be efficient. I want to contribute to the design of such an artificial brain and
  I am currently focusing on chip design tools for the Neurogrid project.
