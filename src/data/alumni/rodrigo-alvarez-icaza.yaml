bio: My interest is to populate the world with self-sufficient artificial agents that
  "live" and work among us. However, given the present state of technology, this will
  probably not occur during my lifetime and thus, for the time being, I have chosen
  to focus on removing a major obstacle by advancing the real-world interaction capabilities
  of robotic systems.
