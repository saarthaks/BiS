bio: Training neuromorphic hardware to perform specific tasks requires learning algorithms
  that are robust to a variety of uncertainties and noise sources. My goal is to use
  theoretical ideas from machine learning and statistics to design algorithms that
  can effectively learn on neuromorphic hardware.
