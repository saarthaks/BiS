bio: Being an active, lifelong learner, I choose to work in this lab as a hardware
  engineer because there is no shortage of learning opportunities.  Working with neuromorphic
  systems offers me many opportunities, including designing a low-power chip using
  nanoscale transistors operating in the subthreshold region.
