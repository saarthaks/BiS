bio: The human inner ear, namely the cochlea, functions as the front-end of the auditory
  pathway, turning sound  into neural impulses that travel up to the cortex. My goal
  is to mimic the cochlea's nonlinear active behavior in silicon, while satisfying
  the engineering constraints of minimizing silicon area and power consumption.
