bio: "Computers have always fascinated me, and the brain is the ultimate computer.\
  \ My goal is to develop computer architectures that are inspired by the brain\xEF\
  \xBF\xBDs functional paradigms. Since these paradigms give rise to an incredibly\
  \ efficient and feature-rich construct in our own biology, I believe that architectures\
  \ derived from this biology will share the same qualities."
