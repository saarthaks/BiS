bio: It is my goal to understand how the brain controls the musculoskeletal system
  by combining theoretical and experimental approaches. I am building controllers
  for human musculoskeletal models, which reveal what neural control is necessary
  and sufficient, and am applying these theoretical insights to design functional
  MRI experiments that will elucidate how the brain's motor regions control the musculoskeletal
  system.
