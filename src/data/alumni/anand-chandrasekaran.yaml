bio: The brain wires itself up and a significant fraction of those connections are
  highly specific. There is strong evidence that these specific connections are a
  result of activity dependent changes to the arbor structure of axons that innervate
  them. I am currently focused on implementing dynamic routing of axons based on activity
  dependent cues on chip.
