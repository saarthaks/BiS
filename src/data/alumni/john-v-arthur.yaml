bio: "It is my goal to understand how the hippocampus functions as an episodic memory,\
  \ and to apply this knowledge to build a hippocampal model in silicon. All three\
  \ hippocampal regions\u2014dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3\u2014are important in episodic\
  \  memory and receive highly processed sensory data from the cortical hierarchy."
