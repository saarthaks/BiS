bio: The ultimate goal is to make an artificial brain. The lab has had success devising
  the first stage, the silicon retina, which includes thirteen  cell types. The cortex
  is more daunting, with  billions of neurons, divided into an undetermined taxonomy.
  Rather than  trace every circuit out by hand, I would like to devise a simple rule
  that can self-organize neural circuits automatically.
