bio: I have always been impressed with the brain's ability to seamlessly integrate  large
  numbers of input (sensory information) and output variables (motor output). What
  is it about the brain that makes it better at real-world applications? Can we understand
  its technique for efficiently coordinating massive amounts of data, and build similar
  systems in hardware?
