bio: My thesis topic is the design of a silicon LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus).
  The LGN is the  area within the thalamus through which retinal signals  flow. It
  was originally thought to simply  relay sensory information to cortex. However,
  the retinal input makes up only  1/4 of all afferents, which is quite low for "just
  a relay point".
