bio: My research involves quantifying some of the computations realized by the mammalian
  retina in order to model this first stage of visual processing in silicon. A study
  of the retina's  seemingly simple architecture reveals several layers of complexity
  that underly its ability to convey visual information to higher cortical structures.
