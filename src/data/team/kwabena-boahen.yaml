  Being a scientist at heart, I want to understand how cognition arises from
  neuronal properties. Being an engineer by training, I am using silicon
  integrated circuits to emulate the way neurons compute, linking the seemingly
  disparate fields of electronics and computer science with neurobiology and
  medicine.
