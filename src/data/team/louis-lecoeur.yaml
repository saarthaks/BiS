bio: >-
    As an EE PhD student, I posit that the brain's computational prowess and energy efficiency stem from its structured 3D neural connections. By drawing from first principles, deriving insights from graph and information theory, and integrating electronic circuit and device design, I want to pioneer a 3D chip to emulate the brain's interconnect.
